# Coffee Shop UI Design

This repository features a user interface design for a **Coffee Shop** app, created in **Figma**. The design includes key screens such as the **Home Screen**, **Product Pages**, and **Favorites Section**.

## Custom Home Button Icon Design

One of the notable aspects of this project is the **custom home button icon** that I designed entirely from scratch. I used Figmaâ€™s **Pen Tool**, **Rectangles**, and **Circles** to create a clean, minimalistic icon that fits well within the app's navigation. The icon is located at the bottom of the **Home Screen**, providing a straightforward and intuitive way for users to return to the main page.

### Icon Design Process:
- **Tools Used**: Figma (Pen Tool, Rectangles, Circles)
- **Design Elements**: Simple geometric shapes were combined to create a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing icon.
- **Placement**: The icon is strategically placed at the bottom of the Home Screen to enhance user experience and facilitate quick navigation.
